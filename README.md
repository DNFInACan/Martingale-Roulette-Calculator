# Martingale-Roulette-Calculator
Calculates the probability of your rolls making money in roulette.
(I made this so I could fuel my gambling addiction.)

## Usage
Simply just run the code, type in a bet value and a file named "CalculatedBet.txt" should be created. 
This can be changed under the FILE_NAME variable.
